## Usage
CheatX communicates over telnet, meaning you can use a telnet CLI to interact with the plugin.
On Windows, you can connect to the Xbox in cmd by entering `telnet <Xbox IP> 731`.
(Some Windows PCs may need telnet client enabled under 'Turn Windows features on or off' in Control Panel in order to use this)

You can always find an up-to-date list of commands for CheatX on the [commands](docs/commands/README.md documentation page.
