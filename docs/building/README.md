## Building
For those who wish to help out, I'm specifically using JayFoxRox's [dxt branch](https://github.com/JayFoxRox/nxdk/tree/dxt) of nxdk, as building DXTs is not yet supported in mainline nxdk. Just [follow the setup guide](https://github.com/JayFoxRox/nxdk/tree/dxt#getting-started).

The below commands should be executed inside the folder that the nxdk folder is present in, so you have the nxdk folder and CheatX folder next to eachother.

```
git clone https://github.com/Voxel9/CheatX.git
cd CheatX/plugin
make
```

Then place the resulting DXT from the `bin` folder into `E:\devkit\dxt` on your Xbox HDD.
